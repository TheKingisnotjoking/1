A program for quick communication with the owner of the car.
  For whom: for public use.
  Problems: The main one is to quickly contact the owner of the transport (for example, children were playing football near the parking lot, as a result they left a dent on one of the cars, a passerby saw it and informed the owner, finding him by the car number), additional ones are the search for timetables of minibuses, buses and trains, search for taxis at a reasonable price and of good quality. 
  This program is a tool that allows you to get information about a person's contacts by the number of his car. It is designed to facilitate the process of identifying the owner and the relevant contacts when only the car number is available.
  The program works on the basis of a database containing information about registered cars and their owners. The user enters the car number in the appropriate field, after which the program performs a database search.
  If the search is completed successfully, the program displays the following information about the owner of the car: full name, contact details (phone number and/or email address), as well as other available information (for example, the registration address of the car).
  If the car number is not found in the database, the program informs the user about it. This can happen if the vehicle number is not registered or the database does not contain relevant information about the owner.
  To register in the program, you will need a full name (your own full name or the name of the organization), contact information (phone number, email address, etc.), a driver's license, a document for the right to own a car, a technical passport of the car and a state registration number. For a person who does not have a vehicle, it is enough to specify the full name and contact information (phone number, email address, etc.).
  The program is designed taking into account the preservation of personal data and confidentiality. It is available in full access to organizations or individuals who have access to the relevant database. Public access to the program is restricted in order to avoid misuse of information about car owners. A paid subscription is also provided, expanding access to use (partially or completely removing restrictions).
  Thus, this program facilitates the process of identifying a person's contacts by the number of his car, providing access to relevant information from the database. This saves time and effort that was previously required to manually search for the car owner's contacts.
