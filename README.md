# AutoConnect - let's take care of the nerves of car owners.
  ## For whom:
  Mainly for vehicle owners.
  ## Problems:
  The main one is to quickly contact the owner of the transport (for example, children were playing football near the parking lot, as a result they left a dent on one of the cars, a passerby saw it and informed the owner, finding him by the car number), additional ones are the search for timetables of minibuses, buses and trains, search for taxis at a reasonable price and of good quality. 
  ## Decision:
  <p>Presentation of the program
This program is a tool that allows you to get information about a person's contacts by his car number. It is designed to facilitate the process of identifying the owner and the relevant contacts when only the car number is available.<br/>
 <p> The program works on the basis of a database containing information about registered cars and their owners. The user enters the number of the car in the appropriate field, after which the program searches the database.<br/>
 <p> If the search is successful, the program displays the following information about the owner of the car: full name (full name), contact details (phone number and /or email), as well as other available information (for example, the address of the registration of the car).<br/>
 <p> If the car number is not found in the database, the program informs the user about it. This can happen if the vehicle number is not registered or the database does not contain relevant information about the owner.
To register for the program, you will need a full name (full name or name of the organization), contact information (phone number, e-mail, etc.), a driver's license, a document for the right to own a car, a technical passport of the car and a state registration number. For a person without a vehicle, a full name (full name) and contact information (phone number, e-mail, etc.) are sufficient, documents for identification and legality may be required.<br/>
 <p> The program is designed taking into account the preservation of personal data and confidentiality. It is available in full access to organizations or individuals who have access to the relevant database. Public access to the program is restricted to prevent misuse and misuse of information about car owners. A paid subscription is also provided, expanding access to use (partially or completely removing restrictions).
 <p> The program also provides the following features to the user: a calendar for tracking car control obligations, a chat/forum for communicating with other users, a platform for sale, a map of the area with useful designations for the car owner, a library with legislation and additional materials related to vehicles, as well as a built-in messenger for connecting users and a special function for obtaining contact information on vehicle number. <br/>
 <p> Thus, this program facilitates the process of identifying a person's contacts by the number of his car, providing access to relevant information from the database. It saves the time and effort that was previously required to manually search for the car owner's contacts.<br/>
 <p>Brief structure:<br/>
 <p>1. Calendar<br/>
 <p>2. Chat/Forum<br/>
 <p>3. Shop<br/>
 <p>4. Map<br/>
 <p>5. Library<br/>
 <p> 6. Messenger<br/>
<p>  The program will consist of the following components:<br/>
<p>  1. Calendar: Allows users to keep records of car service dates, insurance policies and other important events. Users will be able to add, edit and delete entries to always be aware of their obligations.<br/>
 <p> 2. Chat /forum: It will be an opportunity to discuss issues related to car maintenance, traffic rules, service stations, etc. Users will be able to ask questions, share their knowledge and experience, as well as receive help from other participants. To control the quality of content, a chatbot will be used, which will check user messages. In case of misunderstanding by the bot, the message will be sent to the person for consideration.<br/>
 <p> 3. Internal store: Will provide an opportunity for users to place ads for the sale of cars, spare parts, accessories and other products related to automotive topics. Users will be able to view ads and contact sellers to make purchases.<br/>
<p>  4. Map with signs: An interactive map will be available to users, on which the nearest gas stations, car shops, service stations, parking lots, insurance organizations and other objects related to the automotive infrastructure will be marked. In addition, a navigation function will be provided for convenient movement between these points.<br/>
<p>  5. Library: It will provide the user with access to reference materials, legislation related to road transport, as well as instructions and reviews for various car models. Here users will be able to familiarize themselves with the rules of the road, get information about car maintenance and find useful tips.<br/>
<p>  6. The built-in messenger provides users with the ability to exchange messages in the style of WhatsApp or Viber, creating a convenient connection between participants. In addition, this functionality allows you to ask questions and get advice from other users. However, the most notable element is the presence of a contact information search function by vehicle number. It is only necessary to enter the number in the search, and the program will check the databases, if there is relevant data, the user will receive the contact information of the owner of the vehicle.<br/>
 <p> This program combines various functions related to cars and provides a wide range of opportunities for car owners. It is designed to simplify and make life easier for motorists by providing them with important and useful tools in one place.<br/>
